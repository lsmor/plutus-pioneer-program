## Installation guide moved.
The instalation guide in this repo has been moved and improved [here](https://github.com/nstankov-bg/docs.plutus-community.com) so there is a single point of documentation for the plutus community. I'll continue pushing to this repo but mainly my own work and study. 

## Repo content:
- installation folder includes instructions for plutus playground. _<< see previous section_
- edited-contracts includes edited version of original IOG, changing some behaviours or adding comments.
- files in edited-contracts aren't meant to be build locally (invalid haskell), but to be copy-pasted into plutus playground.
